# To Do: Functionality we still need to add 
We need to add a way to create hierarchy

headings and todos under the headings

and todos under the todos

any

preceding a text entry with # should turn it into a heading
- should convert to a task
  - should convert to a subtask


We need to be able to deploy it via vercel and for someone else to see all my data. (Other users don't need to change my data, except to add to the notes section.)
