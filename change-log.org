* 2025-09-12 — Sidebar UI Improvements

** Top Priorities Panel
- Redesigned with timeline-style layout featuring vertical connector lines between items
- Icons now styled with navy color on white background with thin navy border (matching Astro timeline component)
- Increased text size to text-base for better readability
- Icons properly sized and consistent across all priority items

** Sidebar Standardization  
- Unified all sidebar panels to w-72 width (288px)
- Affected panels: CompactPriorities, IntentionsPanel, BoardSelector, DataManagement
- Fixed excessive spacing between sidebar and main kanban columns
- Improved visual consistency across all sidebar components

* 2025-09-11 — Updates & UX Improvements

** Priorities
- Added compact "Top Priorities" panel in the left sidebar (under Current Intentions) with tiny icon controls (open/minimize).
- Shows pinned priorities by default; falls back to cards tagged with #top/#priority/#prio/#p1 when pinned is empty.
- Priorities tab simplified to pinned-only view (no clickable card list to the board).

** Deletion
- Fixed delete confirmation dialog: implemented a functional modal so confirm actually deletes.
- Delete icon always rendered at top-right of task cards (visible on hover; hidden in Select Mode only).
- Kept Undo behavior (Cmd+Z or the blue Undo toast) to restore last delete.

** Tasks & Board UX
- New tasks start empty (no auto-generated "Task <id>" content) and enter edit mode immediately.
- Added Select Mode to multi-select and bulk delete tasks (toggle via bottom-right button or command palette).
- Removed duplicate action button from card hover (kept delete only).
- Column colors: added color picker to column headers and applied header background.

** Drag & Drop
- Added KeyboardSensor (dnd-kit) for keyboard-accessible drag/drop.
- Switched collision detection to closestCorners for better drop behavior.
- Updated task.status when moving across columns (drag or keyboard moves).
- Highlight column drop area during drag.

** Boards
- Board list (sidebar) supports drag-to-reorder; top-most becomes default/current.
- On startup, opens the first board in saved order if available.

** Corrections
- Previous note claiming the delete confirmation dialog was removed was inaccurate; the dialog is present and functional now.

* 2025-09-11 — Data Portability

** Feature: JSON Import/Export
- Implemented a new "Data Management" panel in the sidebar.
- Users can now export all application data (boards, tasks, notes, intentions) into a single, human-readable JSON file. This allows for easy backups and manual editing of the data.
- Users can import a previously exported JSON file, which will overwrite the existing data in the browser and reload the application with the new state. This requires user confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.
* 2025-09-12 — Stability Fixes

** JSX Structure
- Fixed a mismatched JSX tree in KanbanBoard that caused a Vite/SWC parse error (extra closing div around the main content). Parsing and builds now succeed.

** Board Picker Resilience
- Added a safety net to repopulate the board list from localStorage when `availableBoards` is empty (e.g., after hot reloads).
- Preserves saved order from `kanban-board-order` and switches to a valid board if needed.
- No data is lost; this only refreshes the in‑memory list.

** New Page: Implementation Intentions
- Added a new "Implementation Intentions" tab and page with the same styling and icon vibe.
- Content is sourced from implementation-intentions.org and rendered into tidy sections.
- Quick switcher added under the board tabs: Board | Implementation Intentions.
