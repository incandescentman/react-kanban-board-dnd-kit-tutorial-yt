- Goals over Urges
Urges are not emergencies. They rise, peak, and fall like waves.  
Every urge is a chance to practice discipline and reinforce identity:  
"I'm practicing being the person I want to be."

** Food & Sugar
- If I crave ice cream after dinner, then I will drink water or make tea, brush my teeth, and remind myself: "The kitchen is closed."  
- If I crave sugar and it's not Sunday, then I will pause 10 minutes, breathe, and say: "I can want this and choose not to have it."  
- If I see pastries at a café, then I will order coffee/tea and repeat: "Goals over urges."  
- If I'm grocery shopping and see sweets, then I will remind myself: "Don't invite urges into the house" and walk past.  
- If I feel incomplete without sugar, then I will reframe: "This is my brain wanting pleasure, not my body needing fuel."

** Nighttime & Sleep
- If I notice it's past 11pm and I'm still on my laptop, then I will close it and start my bedtime routine immediately.  
- If I find myself vibecoding past bedtime, then I will save work, close the laptop, and read in bed for 5 minutes instead.  
- If I catch myself saying "just one more thing," then I will remind myself: "Sleep is the ultimate productivity hack" and shut things down.  
- If a bug is still unfixed at bedtime, then I will note it down and stop --- bugs wait, sleep doesn't.  

** Writing & Productivity
- If I feel the urge to reorganize files or do busywork instead of writing, then I will set a timer and write one sentence first.  
- If I think "I'm not in the mood to write," then I will open the draft and type for 5 minutes before reassessing.  
- If I procrastinate on job hunting, then I will start a 25-minute timer and complete one small task.  
- If I catch myself scrolling instead of writing, then I will close the app and begin a pomodoro.  
- If I feel overwhelmed, then I will pick the smallest actionable item and do only that.  

** Emotional Regulation & Stress Eating
- If I feel anxious about my job search, then I will take three breaths and list one thing I accomplished today.  
- If I feel the urge to eat when stressed, then I will pause, breathe, and do one physical action (walk, stretch, push-ups) before deciding on food.  
- If I notice an urge rising, then I will pause, take 3 slow breaths, and label it: "This is an urge, not a command."  
- If I hear rationalizations ("It won't matter," "I'll start tomorrow"), then I will counter with: "The future is built now --- today counts."  
- If I slip up, then I will say: "I'm human. I can reset right now" and return to my plan.  

** Reframes & Mantras
- "Goals over urges."  
- "Five minutes of pleasure, or five hours of pride --- I choose pride."  
- "Impulse control is my superpower."  
- "I can feel this urge without being controlled by it."  
- "I'm practicing being the person I want to be."  
- "This discomfort is growth in disguise."  
- "Every choice either feeds my goals or feeds my impulses."  
- "The satisfaction of progress tomorrow will outlast the satisfaction of this momentary pleasure."



Looking at your "Goals over urges" document and your current implementation intentions, here's a revised version that incorporates your key insights and mantras:

* Implementation Intentions: Goals Over Urges

** Core Mantra
*"Goals over urges"* --- This is my hierarchy of values. Every choice reinforces who I am.

** Food/Sugar Implementation Intentions

*Cafe/Afternoon Triggers:*
- If I see a pastry at a café, then I will pause, say "Goals over urges," and order my coffee black.
- If I feel the pull toward a scone, then I will label it: "This is just my brain wanting pleasure, not my body needing fuel."

*Post-Dinner Cravings:*
- If I crave ice cream after dinner, then I will remind myself: "This is my brain wanting pleasure, not my body needing anything" and brush my teeth immediately.
- If I feel incomplete without dessert, then I will acknowledge: "I can feel this urge without being controlled by it" and make tea instead.

*Sugar on Non-Sundays:*
- If I crave sugar and it's not Sunday, then I will say: "I'm practicing being the person I want to be" and wait 10 minutes (urge surfing).
- If my brain says "I'll just start tomorrow," then I will recognize the Tomorrow Trap and say: "This moment is building my superpower."

*Bargaining Thoughts:*
- If I hear myself thinking "It doesn't matter that much" or "I'll eat less later," then I will label it: "That's bargaining" and counter with: "Five minutes of pleasure, or five hours of pride --- I choose pride."

** Sleep/Screen Time

*Late-Night Vibecoding:*
- If I'm coding past 11pm, then I will say: "The ability to stop when I don't feel like it is a superpower" and close my laptop immediately.
- If I think "just one more thing," then I will remind myself: "Sleep is productivity" and start my bedtime routine.

*Bedtime Resistance:*
- If I feel the urge to keep working past bedtime, then I will say: "This is hard and I'm doing it anyway" and shut everything down.

** Writing/Productivity

*Procrastination:*
- If I feel resistance to job hunting, then I will say: "I make choices according to my values, not my urges" and do one 25-minute session.
- If I'm avoiding writing, then I will remind myself: "Discomfort is growth in disguise" and write just one paragraph.

*Overwhelm:*
- If my to-do list feels crushing, then I will say: "Every action is a vote for who I'm becoming" and pick the smallest task.

** Urge Management Protocol

*The Moment of Urge:*
1. *Notice:* "This is craving language, not truth."
2. *Label:* Identify the pattern (minimizing, bargaining, pleasure framing)
3. *Surf:* "This urge will peak and pass in 10-20 minutes."
4. *Choose:* "Goals over urges."

*Reframes Ready to Deploy:*
- "I can want something and choose not to have it --- both can be true."
- "Saying no here means saying yes to who I want to become."
- "Every choice either feeds my goals or feeds my impulses."
- "This choice moves me toward or away from my weight loss goal."
- "I am someone who prioritizes health goals over impulses."

*If I Slip:*
- If I give in to an urge, then I will say: "I'm human. The next choice is what matters" and immediately return to "Goals over urges."

** Identity Reinforcement
Before challenging moments, I remind myself:
- "I'm someone who chooses goals over urges."
- "Impulse control is my superpower."
- "I'm practicing being the person I want to be."
