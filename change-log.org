* Fixes for Task Deletion

** Issues
- Delete (trash) icon was not appearing on task cards.
- Even when deletion was triggered, the task would remain on the board, though an "undo" notification appeared.

** Fixes
- **Icon Visibility**: The trash icon was not visible because its SVG code was missing a `stroke` color property, making it invisible by default. This was fixed by adding `stroke="currentColor"` to the SVG, allowing it to inherit the parent button's text color.
- **Button Visibility**: The delete button (containing the icon) was not configured to appear on hover. This was changed to make the button appear when a user hovers over the task card.
- **Deletion Logic**: The `deleteTask` function in the main `KanbanBoard` component was rewritten to be more robust. The original implementation was not reliably updating the board state, causing the task to remain visually present after deletion. The new implementation performs a more targeted update to the state, ensuring the task is removed correctly.

* Improved Deletion Flow

** Changes
- Removed the confirmation dialog for task deletion. Deletion is now immediate upon clicking the trash icon.
- Verified that the Command-Z undo functionality correctly restores deleted tasks.
