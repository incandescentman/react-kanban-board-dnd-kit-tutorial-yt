* Rising Action Kanban

A powerful, local-first kanban board application for managing tasks, projects, and daily intentions with a rich feature set designed for power users.

** Features

*** Board & Project Management
- *Multi-Board Support*: Manage multiple, distinct kanban boards for different projects or contexts.
- *Board Management*: Create, delete, rename, and reorder your boards.
- *Persistent Storage*: All boards, tasks, and notes are automatically saved to your browser's =localStorage=.

*** Data Portability
- *Export to JSON*: Download all your boards, tasks, and notes into a single, human-readable JSON file for backups or manual editing.
- *Import from JSON*: Load your entire workspace from a JSON file, with a confirmation step to prevent accidental data loss.

*** Columns and Tasks
- *Columns*: Create, delete, rename, and reorder columns. Customize columns with background colors.
- *Tasks*: Create, edit, and delete tasks with full undo/redo support.
- *Drag & Drop*: Intuitively move tasks between columns, reorder them within a column, and organize them into groups.
- *Task Completion*: Mark tasks as complete with a single click.

*** Advanced Organization
- *Task Groups (Headings)*: Automatically create sub-groups of tasks by starting a task with Markdown heading syntax (e.g., =# My Group=). Any list items below it will become tasks in that group.
- *Tagging*: Add tags to tasks using the =#tag= syntax. 
- *Tag View*: See all tasks across the board that share a specific tag in a dedicated view.

*** Power-User Features
- *Command Palette (⌘K)*: A pop-up palette to quickly access key actions like adding columns, toggling views, and more.
- *Undo/Redo (⌘Z, ⌘Y)*: A robust undo/redo system for actions like task, column, and board deletion.
- *Select Mode*: A special mode to select multiple tasks at once for batch deletion.
- *Full Keyboard Navigation*: Move between tasks with arrow keys, move tasks with =Ctrl+Arrow=, and use various shortcuts for maximum efficiency.

*** Views & Panels
- *Board View*: The primary kanban interface.
- *Priorities View*: A dedicated view to manage and import top priorities (currently hidden but component preserved at lines 1620-1647 in KanbanBoard.tsx - uncomment to re-enable Board/Priorities toggle).
- *Values View*: A space to keep your personal or project values front and center.
- *Intentions Panel*: A sidebar panel with timeline-style layout to list and manage your daily intentions or habits. Features drag-and-drop reordering and inline editing.
- *Top Priorities Panel*: Compact sidebar panel showing top 6 priorities with timeline design, drag-and-drop reordering, inline editing, and undo support.
- *Notes Section*: A dedicated space at the bottom of the board for general notes.
- *Keyboard Shortcut Legend ( ? )*: A popup that displays all available keyboard shortcuts.
