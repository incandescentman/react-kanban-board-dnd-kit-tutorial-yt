#+title: Rising Action Kanban — Instructions

* Overview
This app is a local‑first Kanban board with multiple views to help organize tasks and mindset. All data is stored in your browser’s localStorage. No accounts, no servers.

* Install & Run
1. Install Node LTS (18+). 
2. Install dependencies:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   npm install
   #+END_SRC
3. Start dev server (auto‑opens browser):
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   npm run dev
   #+END_SRC
4. Build production bundle:
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
   npm run build && npm run preview
   #+END_SRC

* Views
- Boards (⌘/Ctrl+1): Main Kanban with columns, groups, drag & drop, notes.
- If‑Then (⌘/Ctrl+2): Implementation intentions parsed from =implementation-intentions.org=. Each item renders as “If … Then …”. The “Master Mantras” section remains a simple list.
- Thought → Reframe (⌘/Ctrl+3): Common thoughts paired with mantras to deploy in the moment.

Switch tabs using the top‑left tab row, or use the shortcuts above. The board picker shows on the right side only in the Boards view.

* Data Management (Sidebar)
Icon buttons with hover labels:
- Download (Export): saves a JSON backup of all boards, order, notes, intentions, top priorities, and flags.
- Upload (Import): validates JSON with Zod, loads it without a full reload, updates in‑memory state, and shows a brief summary.
- Rocket (Publish): exports the current view as a standalone HTML file (styles inlined).
- Eye (Preview): opens a preview of the publish HTML in a new tab.
- Globe (Publish All): exports all boards as a single navigable HTML.
- Layers (Preview All): preview the all‑boards publish.

* Keyboard Shortcuts (selected)
- Tabs: ⌘/Ctrl+1 Boards • ⌘/Ctrl+2 If‑Then • ⌘/Ctrl+3 Thought → Reframe
- Undo last delete: ⌘Z (also a visible Undo toast appears after deletions)
- Many task/board actions are available via the Command Palette (⌘K)

* Backup & Restore
1. Export to JSON from Data Management. Keep the file safe (it contains everything).
2. To restore or edit:
   - Edit the JSON by hand (board titles, columns, tasks) if desired.
   - Import via Data Management → Upload. Confirm to overwrite; the app validates and hydrates state immediately (no full reload).
   - Compatibility: importer accepts legacy =pinnedPriorities= and maps it to canonical =topPriorities=.

* State Management
- The app uses Zustand for global state (notes, intentions, top priorities) with a single persisted snapshot.
- On startup, if the store is empty, it recovers from legacy/localStorage keys and shows a brief toast (e.g., “Restored 6 priorities • 5 intentions”).
- Boards remain stored per‑key in localStorage; import refreshes board list without a reload.

* Testing
Run unit tests (Vitest) for data export/import and publish HTML generation:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
npm run test
#+END_SRC

* Notes
- Data is saved per browser origin. If you switch browsers/profiles, export/import to transfer.
- The app migrates older saved structures to the latest format when needed.
